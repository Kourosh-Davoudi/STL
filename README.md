### Task1: 
Write a program that reads the names and grades of students then adds students in a <code>list</code> of <code>Student</code> so that the list is sorted in ascending order of grades (you need to find the appropriate position for the insertion).
The program prints the list (both name and grade) in ascending, and then in descending order (based on grade). 

Hint: You can define a list container like:
```C++
list<Student> c;
``` 
## Task2:
Write a program that reads the name and and grade of students form an input file and print name of students that have a mark less that 50 for the invitation purpose. The the printed list should not have any duplicate.

Hint: You can define a list container like:
```C++
set<string> c;
``` 
Sample input file:
```C++
John 25
Amanda 35
John 45
Sarah  80
Jessica 65
Sarah 30
John 70
```
Sample output file:
```C++
John 
Amanda 
Sarah  
Jessica 
```

### Task3: 
Write a program that reads the name and and grade of students form an input file  then adds, then programs print the name student and the numbers of time that student has a mark less than 50.

Hint: You can define a list container like:
```C++
map<string, int> c;
```
Sample output file:
```C++
John 2
Amanda 1
Sarah  1
Jessica 0
```
